# firebase-db-practice
This is a simple firebase <strong>CRUD</strong> operation practice code in which you enter your basic contact data such as name, email and phone number. <br/>
The data entered, on submit gets <strong>written</strong> in <strong>firebase realtime database</strong>.</br>
After that when you go to viewData page it <strong>reads</strong> all the entries stored in database. <br/>
Also infront of each row you'll have two options one to save and the other to delete the entry. <br/>
To <strong>update</strong> a record simply click on that particular field, edit it and save the changes. </br>
If you want to <strong>delete</strong> a particular record simply click on delete button of that particular row.
